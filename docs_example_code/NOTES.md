# Docs exmaple code

This folder simply contains copy-pasted code from docs.llamaindex.ai with the goal to:
    - explore different things and see what's interesting
    - test that it still works (some doc code doesn't since the core and community builds change so fast)
    - test I can get it working with the given documents

Because of this, the code is sitting outside the main `relevance_pipeline` folder - where the package code sits.
